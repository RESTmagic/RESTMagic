Overview.
-----

RESTmagic is a framework for that framework you already deployed, your RESTFUL api. Light or no configuration will tell the framework how your resources are organized, and where to get the appropriate templates. Before it joins those together with your choice of mustache flavored templating, it will check if you have a native view instead to present. The whole framework is built to be easily customized with as much or as little magic as your want.

Example App
-----
Working on the docs but there is an example app that hooks up to the twitter api. Try extening it by adding more html templates to the templates directory


Usage
-----
Add me to your podfile and then modify the RESTMagic sample plist and add it to your project this is where the settings come from.
